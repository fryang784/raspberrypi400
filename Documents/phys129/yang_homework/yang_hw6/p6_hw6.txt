====================
Problem Description:
6. Get Web Page with Requests. Write a Python program that prints out for the user
when the Physics 129 web page announcements were last updated. Retrieve the course
web page using requests, and process the result using either string methods or bs4.
Hints:
If you decide to use bs4, you may need to import re and use a BeautifulSoup method
to search for text = re.compile(’RE’), where ’RE’ is a regular expression that
matches the text you want to find.

====================

	The program relevant to this problem is titled "p6_hw6.py" (hereby called "the program"). 

Begin description of the program below:
-------------------

	The program here achieves exactly the same output as the program in p5_hw6.py and in p4_hw6.sh, but its format is drastically more compact and much more user friendly. This is all thanks to the python module, "requests". 

	Line 36 of the program ('p6_hw6.py') replaces line 34-95 of 'p5_hw6.py'. By simply calling the requests.get(URL) method, a web page connection is automatically established, and a lot of the data, including the string of the page's html is already saved. 

	By following the same string parsing procedure as in 'p5_hw6.py', the program prints out the latest update time. 

	This is a great example of how Python is time-efficient on the user's end.
