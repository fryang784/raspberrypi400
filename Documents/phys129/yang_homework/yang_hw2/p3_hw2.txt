====================

3. Mounting and Using a Disk. For each step in this procedure, either run the given command or decide what you have to do. If a command you run produces output, copy the output into the answer file.

a. Run cat /proc/partitions | grep sd

	returns nothing. This shows that there is no partition with pattern "sd". 

b. Insert your flash drive into the Raspberry Pi, and run cat /proc/partitions | grep sd again. Your flash drive should now be available, probably as device /dev/sda. If it is assigned a different device name, substitute that for sda below.

		cat /proc/partitions | grep sd

	returns

			8        0   15015936 sda
			8        1   15014912 sda1

	This shows that the partitions is available (but not necessarily mounted). 

c. Run df | grep sd to see if your drive has been automatically mounted. If so, unmount it and verify that it is no longer mounted.

		df | grep sd

	returns nothing

	This shows the partition is not mounted. 

d. Create a directory under /home/pi to use as a mount point, and mount partition /dev/sda1 there.

	A new directory has been created as /home/pi/USBPort. To mount the partition sda1 here, I typed
	
		sudo mount /dev/sda1 ~/USBport/

	Check the status of the partition now with

		df | grep sd

	returns

		/dev/sda1       14778812  490340  13521344   4% /home/pi/USBport	

	which shows that partition sda1 has been mounted to /home/pi/USBport. 

e. Run sudo mount | grep sd with no arguments.

	returns

		cgroup2 on /sys/fs/cgroup/unified type cgroup2 (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,nsdelegate)
		gvfsd-fuse on /run/user/1000/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1000,group_id=1000)
		/dev/sda1 on /home/pi/USBport type ext4 (rw,relatime)

	This pulls out all lines of sudo mount that contains the pattern "sd" in it. 

f. Run df | grep sd to confirm your disk is mounted.

	Yes, already done in part d. It returns

		/dev/sda1       14778812  490340  13521344   4% /home/pi/USBport	

g. Create a small text file on the mounted drive.

	To create a text file, I typed 

		echo "This is a text file." > /home/pi/USBport/foo.txt

h. Unmount the flash drive.

	To unmount, type

		cd 
		sudo umount ~/USBport/

i. Run sudo mount | grep sd with no arguments.

	returns

		cgroup2 on /sys/fs/cgroup/unified type cgroup2 (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,nsdelegate)
		gvfsd-fuse on /run/user/1000/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1000,group_id=1000)

	Notice that there are only two lines now this time. The last line in section e on the partition is no longer present. 

j. Run df | grep sd to confirm your disk is unmounted.

	returns nothing. This indeed shows the disk is unmounted. 

k. Mount /dev/sda1 on /mnt.

	To mount, type

		sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/

l. Run cat /mnt/filename, where filename is the name of the file you created, to show you can read it off the disk

	run

		cat /mnt/foo.txt

	returns

		This is a text file. 

	Just as expected!
