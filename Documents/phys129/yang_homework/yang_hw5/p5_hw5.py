# p5_hw5.py - Mandelbrot set visualization
# 29Apr22   Richard Yang,

# Problem Description:
# 5. Mandelbrot Set. 
# A complex number c is in the Mandelbrot Set if upon repeated iteration the 
# expression z_(n+1) = z_n**2 + c, with z_0 = 0, does not diverge. In other 
# words, |z_n| remains bounded no matter the value of n. In typical 
# illustrations, the complex plane is shown with the Mandelbrot Set in black 
# and the surrounding points c colored according to the number n of iterations 
# required for | z_n**2 + c | to exceed some chosen value.
# Write a program that plots an interesting region of the complex plane in this
# fashion.
# Note: a region containing the whole set is hardly the most interesting you 
# can choose; try zooming in near the edges. Use a grid of 512x384 pixels, and 
# a limit of 250 iterations per point. In other words, if | z_n**2 + c | is 
# still below some small limit of your choosing (think about what a good choice
# might be) after 250 iterations, assume it is in the set.
# Save your plot as a PostScript file (not .eps) and use the translate and 
# scale operators to center the image on the page at a size that leaves 
# 56-point horizontal margins. A good place to put these commands is 
# immediately following the line
# \%%Page: 1 1
# Convert the PostScript file to PDF using ps2pdf and turn in the PDF file with
#  the code
# and text file for the problem.
# Hints: You will probably find it useful to use a smaller grid until you have 
# debugged and optimized your code. It will also help to include some print 
# statements that notify you of the programâ€™s progress.
# See cmapimg.py in $HOME/physrpi/python/ on your RPi for an example of 
# plotting points with a color map rather than explicit RGB values.
