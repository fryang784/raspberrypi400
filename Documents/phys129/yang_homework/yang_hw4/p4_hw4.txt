====================
Problem Description:
4. Fibonacci Numbers. 
Write a program that takes as a command line argument a single number n, 
then prints the first n Fibonacci numbers starting with 1, 1, 2, 3, . . .
Make sure your output has no more than 75 characters per line. You may limit 
the output to numbers with 75 or fewer digits. 
Avoid recursion; it can be inefficient in Python.
====================

	The program relevant to this problem is titled "p4_hw4.py" (hereby called "the program").

Begin description of the program below:
--------------------
	The program uses the idea of a boxcar to compute Fibonacci number up to a user specified term N, and prints out the Fibonacci series up to term N. 

	First, robust error-handling is used to make sure the user inputed term N is a natural number. 

	If N > 75, then only the terms up to and including the 75th term of the series will be printed, as specified by the problem.
