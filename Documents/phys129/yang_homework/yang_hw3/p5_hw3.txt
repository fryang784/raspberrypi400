5. Finding Files. 
Explain the function of the dfr alias that has been installed on your
RPi. Make sure your explanation is complete

	To view the alias of dfr, I typed in a terminal:

		alias dfr

	which returns:

		alias dfr='find . -maxdepth 1 -mtime -1 -o -ctime -1'

	This shows that the alias dfr is some specific configuration of the function called "find".

	To see what kind of function is "find", use

		type -a find

	which returns:

		find is /usr/bin/find

	That is, the find function is binary function, which means it has a manual page. To access the manual, use

		man find

	which shows me entry (1), General Commands Manual, of the find function, which shows that find function searches for files in a directory hierarchy. 

	The period ('.') that appears after find specifies the current directory as the starting-point.  

	-maxdepth 1 means descend at most 1 level of directories below the starting-point. 

	-mtime is an option under the TESTS section, and it concerns when a file's content was last modifed. -mtime -1 is true if a file's content was last modified less than 1 day ago. 

	-o is the 'or' operator. Note that the second expression is not evaluated if the irst expression is true. 

	-ctime is an option under the TESTS section, and it concerns when a file's status was last changed. This includes changes to its permission. -ctime -1 is true if a file's status was last changed less than 1 day ago. 

	In total, this alias says: "find me all the files within 1 depth lower than the current directory, whose content was last modified less than 1 day ago or its status was last changed less than 1 ago."
