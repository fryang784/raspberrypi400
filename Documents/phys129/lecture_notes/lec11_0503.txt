FIFOs and stsacks

	FIFO: first in, first out (queue)
		Note to self, the FIFO and the Stack desription might have been opposite!
		 [1,2,3]  <- 4 	# deque([1,2,3]), append
		 [1,2,3,4]
	1 <- [1,2,3,4] 		# deque.popleft()
		 [2,3,4]
	
	stack: last in, first out, opposite behavior


--------------------
PDF and postscript

	a PDF is just a postscript file. The difference is, whereas postscript can have loops in it, a PDF file, when it is made, preprocesses all the loops and prints out the code for the content just is. 

	in ps, gv bigletter.ps

Networking

	application email, http
	transport 	TCP, UDP	
	network 	IP (Wide Area Network, WAN)
	link 		ethernet (Local Area Network, LAN)
					allows you to packet* your data into 1 and 0
	physical 	cable, radio wave, optical cable, etc
					allows you to send 1 and 0. 	


	packet: 
		header
			address of sender
