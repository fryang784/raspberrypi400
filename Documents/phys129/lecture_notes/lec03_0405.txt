====================

hand out items handed out. Check they contain 5 items.

HW2 is posted. 

Recorded lecture notes can be found on the phys129 website. 
These lectures are recorded in spring 2020. They are purposefully long. Can pause and watch again. Can also be downloaded to local machine--they are just mp4 files. 


ASCII chart

xxd: "hexadecimal dump"

0x20 = 32 in decimal. I.e., 2*16^1 + 0*16^0 = 32

ASCII text is very old fashioned. It does not support accents, and include only english. 

Some other encoding format is, i.e. UTF-8

bash command: cat
spits out the raw content of the txt file onto the screen. 
If the file is not a txt file, it may screw up your terminal (i.e. do not use a binary file!)

bash command: less
a pager program. Displays the one-page worth of text onto your terminal. Can use <space> to jump to the next page, <Enter> to display the next line, and <b> to jump to previous page.

Python
Everything to be turned in must run in command prompt.

Type "python3" in terminal will boot you to the command prompt.

Type "ipython3". Interactive python shell. Has built-in help, saves what you do so you can look back. 

Can also use an integrative development environment, and IDE.  
For example, type "spyder3" 

Command shell
ls: stands for list.
alias ls: see what the alising is for ls (this is configured by lipman)
ls -a: list "all" the files
ls -l: "long" listing. 
Note: can combine the options, i.e. ls -al
chmod filename: makes the file executable. 
\ls: run the command ls without any aliasing
type -a ls: tells the aliasing of the command "ls"

Just about every command in the command prompt has a manual page. 
Type "man ls" to see the manual page of "ls"

type -a cd: cd is a shell builtin. This means it is not a separate shell command. It is already built in. For built-in shell command, type "help cd"

type "help cd | less". This | is known as a pipe. It means execute "help cd" and throw the output into the program "less"
In the man of a bin command, type "/ -F" to search for "-F"

To recap: a binary file has a manual page; type man to look for the manual. a built-in command has instead a help page; type help to look for that help page. 

type "hist" to look for the history of all the command. Type "!201" to run the command in line 201. ("!" is pronounced as "bang")

All the command prompt history is stored in the .bash_history. To remove the history, rm the .bash_history file. The current history will be saved in the file when you shutdown the machine. So to remove current history, reboot the machine and remove the .bash_history file. 

Alias: 
alias foo = 'echo "Hi there!"'
type "alias" to see all the alias. 
type "unalias foo" to unalias foo. 

This is a super helpful command. You can create alias for complicated command in the shell prompt. 
All the aliases are stored in the .bashrc. rc stands for run command. The machine runs these files before doing anything when it is turned on.
