====================

Pythonic factorization

	If b is a np.array, c is a single number, then 

		c = a % b

	c is a numpy array that contains the solution of a mod every element in b, done in parallel

	Then, all we need to now is 

		b[ c == 0]

	Returns the elements which c == 0, ordered by the same index!

--------------------
To install packages:

	In scripts, view getpackages_physrpi
	
	Key command: 

		COMMAND="aptitude"

	Similar to apt-get, but checks for dependency and only get what is needed

	Suppose we want to install a package called banner:

		apt list | grep -i banner

--------------------
argument.py in scripts

	In shell:

		arguments.py 0 1 2

	This returns the list of argument, and the count. Note that the first argument, which is indexed 0, is always the name of the program. After that comes whatever the user typed. 


--------------------
Operator precedence

	Example, in python:

		1+1*3

	Returns 4

	Python has a ranking of all operators, and it execute a line of code by order of precedence. If two operators have the same precedence, it goes in the order of appearance. 


	Can force precedence by enclosing a math operation with ( )

--------------------
Deeper dive into numpy arrays.

	Recall in np.array, we can do fractional steps. 

	Can also do np.linspace:

		a = np.linspace(1,20,30)

	The third argument is the number of elements in your list. Note that this is fine, i.e. fractional step is okay.


	np has a function np.loadtxt. It loads the file as a np.array (which means all elements have to be in the same data type)

--------------------
np transpose:

	if a is an array, can do:

		b = a.T

	Note that this does not change the allocation in memory. (but a.T is a is false...?) a.T returns a different view, of the same memory. If we do operations on b, the corresponding element in a will also be changed. 

	If you want to make a new memory, use

		c = a.copy.T

--------------------
plotting

		f1, ax1 = plt.subplots()

	This creates a figure object and an axis object. Otherwise, the matplotlib library assumes a state machine structure, as in matlab, which only plots one figure at a time. 

	If you want to plot something on top of an existing figure, just plot. There is no need of hold on, hold off, unlike in Matlab.

--------------------
encapsulated postscript vs postscript

	The difference is subtle. eps allows the data to be exported to other format?

--------------------
Graphics

	Two important ways: 
	raster graphics, and 

	A raster graphics will define a color for each pixel (picture element). 1080p, p means progressive, just draw the pixels from the top of the screen down. THe other option is i, which means interlay. This is pretty much outdated. In interlay, the cathode ray tube plots half of the screen from the top to the middle, and then goes up to the top and plot the other half. 

	24 bits = 3 byte, memory needed for colors for one pixel. 

	3 * 1920 * 1080 = 6220800

	6 MB of memory space to hold one screen. This is the memory allocated to your memory card. Often you will have more than 1 screen. 

--------------------
xmag 

	In bash, 

		xmag

	In xmag, you can view the colors of any pixel. Note that the pixel is in 64 bit, and displayed in hexadecimal. 

--------------------
raster image, in python

	Watch the online lecture!

--------------------
Colormap

	Maps a single number to a single color. 
	Use cmap. 
	This allows you to give one value to assign a unique color. 

--------------------
vector graphics

	raster graphics is very low level. 

	Another way to do graphics is by using vector graphics. This plots the image of an object as defined by mathematical functions. 

	Ghostscript, type gs

	Also read over the lecture note.
