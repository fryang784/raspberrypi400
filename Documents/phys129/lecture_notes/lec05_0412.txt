====================

	Lecture note is posted on the course webpage. 

	To access, use the same password: 0x81L~S22

	The lecture note (a pdf file) contains all the lectures, each with a new number as the section header. 

	 In the command line, if you type a backslash line "\" and immediately hit enter, the shell command will understand you want to continue typing. 

	Make sure to do the reading! The reading will cover a lot of the stuff you will need to do the homework. 

--------------------

	Last lecture, we ended with ps

	ps tells you the processes going on in your machine. 

	Everything in your linux machine is lumped into either a file or a process. 

	If you type 
	
		ll partitions

	You will see partitions has a 0 byte. But if you type

		cat partitions

	you clearly see there is clearly a lot more data. This is because partitions is a "virtual file". It's a "file", but is actually linked to a device in your machine. 

	If you type 

		tty

	you will see the virtual file that your current terminal is stored in.

	If you type

		echo "Hi there!" > /dev/pts/2

	(if you opened a second terminal,) the word will appear on the second terminal display!

	--------------------
	$$

		echo $$

	will tell you the process number of your terminal (?)

	--------------------
	Standard output and standard input

	By default standard output and standard error are both wired to your display screen. To not see the error message, we can use 

		grep hi * 2> dev/null

	(grep hi * means search for hi in the files in the current directory). The redirection 2> means the standard error is redirected to /dev/null, i.e. the virtual garbage can. 

--------------------
	User id:

		id -a

	tells you all the user groups you belong to. 

	Use
	
		view /etc/group

	to view all the user groups (including audio, GPIO, I2C, etc.)

--------------------
	If you own a file, you can change the permission of the file. 

	suppose you have the file text.txt

		ll text.txt

	by default, a file will give read and write permission to pi, and read permission to other users. (who are the other users?)

	To change the mode of user, use 

	chmod 700 text.txt

	The number 700 is broken down into its 3 digits. Each digit stands for its binary format. For instance, 7 is 111, which turns on "read", "write", and "executable"

--------------------
	To find a program, i.e. proctemp

		type -a proctemp

	There are two variables $PATH and $CDPATH. They are executable path and search path. For security purposes, "." is always the last entry in $PATH. 	

--------------------
	In vim:

		:r! ls

	the "!" mark means vim will execute the command that comes next, and print out its output in the file. 

	To search for a keyword in the manual page, use

		man -k keyword

	where you substitute the keyword with what you want to search for. 

--------------------
	Now on to Python
