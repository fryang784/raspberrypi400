This is an example document written in \LaTeX, a set
of macros for Donald~Knuth's \TeX\ typesetting system.
\LaTeX\ is free, portable, extremely powerful, reliable,
and produces output of \red{far higher quality} than typical
word processing programs.  In addition, \TeX\ was designed
from the ground up to do professional-quality typesetting
of mathematics:
\[\oint \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}.\]

\caption[]{\label{fig:wind}\small
Data shown are averages of measurements gathered from
the National Airport web site at one-hour intervals over
a 67-day period.  1-$\sigma$ error bars represent sample
standard deviations.  The data clearly indicate that the
best time for sailing on the Potomac is mid-afternoon.

As you can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:wind}, a \LaTeX\ document
can include EPS graphics.  The author can rescale these
figures from inside the document.
